# NExLib Godot template
A Godot template project using my networking library, NExLib.

Feel free to use for your own projects!

## Warning  
This project is still in development, and will be updated with progress from my other repository [fps-multiplayer](https://github.com/steveplays28/fps-multiplayer).  
I don't reccommend using it for your projects, unless you're ok with modifying it, as well as NExLib, a lot.

## Development  
This project was made with Godot 3.4.

This section will be updated with more information once the project is read.
